# Better Golems!

## Description

I have many many gripes with current minecraft golems as they are:
- Seemingly useless
- Literally only serve as an iron dropping mob
- Fail to protect villagers
- Wander off at their own behest

I do however have many ideas to fix them which will be added and updated here:
- Golems will no longer wander off
- Golems will stick near villagers
- Golems will feel like part of the village
